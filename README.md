### My Second Act as a Writer
For 12 blissful years, I fully immersed myself in the pure joy and love that comes with motherhood and building a strong family foundation. I cherished every moment spent with my children, watching them grow and learn, and I am forever grateful for the invaluable experiences and lessons that this time has given me. And now, I'm excited to take on new adventures and opportunities as I pursue my passion for writing.
